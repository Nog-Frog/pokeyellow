# Pokémon Yellow

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Yellow.
It has been modified to allow Hebrew language compatibility,
and is in the process of being translated into Hebrew.

Almost all of the code for Hebrew compatibility is from
[**LIJI32**](https://github.com/LIJI32)'s old modification on top
of pokered, called [pokeadom](https://github.com/LIJI32/pokeadom).

Thanks so much to Eyal Seelig (link TBA) for porting LIJI32's
6-year-old for the still-currently-updating pokered.

If you'd like to contribute Hebrew translations, please do contact
me either or on Discord (I'm Nog#4061) for a short style guide (style guide
link TBA).
